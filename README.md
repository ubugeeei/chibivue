### [**Writing Vue.js: Step by Step, from just one line of "Hello, World".**](https://book.chibivue.land)

---

chibivue is minimal [vuejs/core](https://github.com/vuejs/core) implementations.  
(Reactivity System, Virtual DOM and Patch Rendering, Component System, Template Compiler, SFC Compiler)

"`chibi`" means "`small`" in Japanese.

This project began in February 2023 with the goal of simplifying the understanding of Vue's core implementation.

Currently, I am still in the process of implementation, but after implementation, I intend to post explanatory articles as well.

(For now, I plan to post Japanese first.)

[example](https://github.com/chibivue-land/chibivue/tree/main/example/app)

# 👜 Package Manager

This project uses [pnpm](https://pnpm.io/) as a package manager.

And use [ni](https://github.com/antfu/ni) .

```sh
# if you don't have ni yet
npm i -g @antfu/ni
```
